# Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`LinearRegression.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model using a dataset (we use a dataset of housing prices in King County, USA).

## Overview
The notebook walks through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset containing housing prices with 5,000 observations and 18 features.
   - Utilize pandas to read and explore the data.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and statistics of the dataset.

## Summary of `LinearRegression.ipynb`

The `LinearRegression.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of a linear regression model. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset using pandas and handle any missing or erroneous data.
   - Perform necessary transformations and feature selection to prepare the data for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data trends and distributions using `matplotlib`.
   - Analyze correlations between features to understand their impact on the target variable (house price).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implement a linear regression model using standard libraries.
   - Train the model on the processed dataset and evaluate its performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model.
   - Visualize the results to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For scientific computing.
- `pandas`: For data analysis and manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can start the notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook LinearRegression.ipynb
```

Ensure that you have the dataset (`data.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
